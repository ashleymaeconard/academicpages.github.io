To me, Computational Biology provides me with a way to understand the enormous beauty and rules governing this game that is life. I strive to uncover these rules because in understanding, we might more easily co-exist with nature, and help ourselves co-habitate, thereby living more harmouniously. Furthermore, I love solving puzzles. Throughout *my* game of life, I have felt the urge to share, and so I will do that here when needed. Coming from a very small town of Lebanon Indiana, I did not know much of what I found others did when moving up north. I want to share what I have learned to continue empowering and inspiring curiosity to uncover the rules to *your* game of life. This blog will be one way I achieve that. (Read on.)

I look forward to passing on neat ideas and action items I have found valuable in my roles as, for example,
  - Ph.D. candidate in Computational Biology and Computer Science from Brown, 
  - Fulbright Association Board Member (2018-2020), 
  - AnitaB.org Board Member (2015-2017), 
  - woman in tech from the Midwestern U.S., 
  - outreach and award creator (like helping start the international [Student of Vision Award](https://anitab.org/awards-grants/abie-awards/student-of-vision/))
  - polyglot (fluent French, Spanish, English; beginner Portuguese, Dutch) consumed by wanderlust
  - Learning at Brown, Princeton, Vanderbilt, Harvard, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory
  
I will be succinct, and in my Ashley way, blunt but kind. 

To begin, these are two articles and talks I enjoyed this week. These demonstrate to me two reasons programming is absolutely beautiful.
