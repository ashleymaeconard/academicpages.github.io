 I am a Computational Biology PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Brown University. My research focuses on building accessible time-series and multi-omics Bayesian inference methods to study gene regulation and visualization tools to enable other researchers to interpret complex biology. During my Brown Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, I focused on modeling subclonal drivers in cancer. At that time, I served on the Board of Trustees for the Anita Borg Institute and as Finance Chair for the ISCB Student Council. I was a 2015 Fulbright Research Scholar using game theory to identify protein binding preferences. I serve on the Board of Trustees for the Fulbright Association. I hold a Computer Science and Biochemistry degree from DePauw University, and spent my summers doing research projects at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Vanderbilt University, and Eli Lilly.
